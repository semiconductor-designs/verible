## Week 5-6 Plan: Production Implementation

### Phase 1: Preprocessor Integration (Current)
**Goal**: Automatically inject macro boundary markers during macro expansion

**TDD Approach - Tests Written First** ✅
- Created `verilog-preprocess-macro-markers_test.cc` with 8 comprehensive tests
- Added test target to `verible/verilog/preprocessor/BUILD`
- Tests currently in **RED phase** (expected - no implementation yet)

**Test Coverage (8 Tests)**:
1. ✅ **ConfigFlagControlsMarkerInjection** - Enable/disable markers via config
2. ✅ **SimpleMacroExpansionWithMarkers** - Basic macro with markers
3. ✅ **NestedMacroExpansionWithMarkers** - 2-level nested macros
4. ✅ **MacroWithArgumentsMarkers** - Parametrized macros
5. ✅ **EventTriggerAfterMacroExpansion** - Original v5.4.2 use case
6. ✅ **OpenTitanDVMacroPattern** - Real-world uvm_info pattern
7. ✅ **MultipleMacrosInSequence** - Sequential macro calls
8. ✅ **NoExpansionNoMarkers** - Markers only when expansion enabled

**Next Steps (Phase 1 GREEN)**:
1. Add `inject_macro_markers` flag to `VerilogPreprocess` config
2. Modify `HandleMacroIdentifier()` to inject `<MACRO_START:name>` before expansion
3. Modify `ExpandMacro()` to inject `<MACRO_END:name>` after expansion
4. Update lexer pattern to support `<MACRO_START:name>` (with macro name)
5. Run tests → achieve TDD GREEN (all 8 tests passing)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Context Preservation (Planned)
**Goal**: Save and restore full parser state, not just task/function context

**Scope**:
- Expand `ContextState` to include:
  - `block_stack_` (begin/end blocks)
  - `balance_stack_` (parentheses, brackets, braces)
  - `flow_control_stack_` (if/for/case blocks)
  - `keyword_label_tracker_` state
- Add tests for complex nesting scenarios
- Validate with OpenTitan edge cases

**Timeline**: 2-3 days after Phase 1

---

### Phase 3: OpenTitan Validation (Planned)
**Goal**: Test on real-world OpenTitan DV codebase

**Scope**:
- Run on all 3911 OpenTitan files with markers enabled
- Validate 100% parse success (building on v5.4.2's 99.13%)
- Performance benchmarking (ensure <5% overhead)
- Memory usage profiling

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% parse success
- <5% performance degradation
- <10MB memory overhead
- No regressions on existing tests

**Timeline**: 2-3 days after Phase 2

---

### Phase 4: Enhanced Heuristic Implementation (Planned)
**Goal**: Implement alternative approach for A/B testing

**Scope**:
- Enhance existing heuristic in `verilog-lexical-context.cc`
- Track more context signals (keyword history, depth counters)
- Add confidence scoring for disambiguation decisions
- Implement same test suite for apples-to-apples comparison

**Timeline**: 3-4 days after Phase 3

---

### Phase 5: A/B Testing & Evaluation (Planned)
**Goal**: Compare macro boundary markers vs enhanced heuristic

**Metrics**:
- Parse success rate
- Performance (throughput, latency)
- Memory usage
- Code complexity
- Maintainability
- Debugability

**Deliverable**: Recommendation document with data-driven decision

**Timeline**: 2-3 days after Phase 4

---

### Phase 6: Production Hardening (Planned)
**Goal**: Prepare for release

**Scope**:
- Error handling for malformed markers
- Diagnostic logging (VLOG levels)
- User documentation
- Integration guide
- Migration notes
- Release notes

**Timeline**: 2-3 days after Phase 5

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Week 3-4: PoC | Complete | ✅ DONE |
| Week 5 Phase 1: Preprocessor Integration | 2-3 days | 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Day 1 - TDD RED) |
| Week 5 Phase 2: Enhanced Context | 2-3 days | ⏳ PLANNED |
| Week 6 Phase 3: OpenTitan Validation | 2-3 days | ⏳ PLANNED |
| Week 6 Phase 4: Enhanced Heuristic | 3-4 days | ⏳ PLANNED |
| Week 7 Phase 5: A/B Testing | 2-3 days | ⏳ PLANNED |
| Week 7 Phase 6: Production Hardening | 2-3 days | ⏳ PLANNED |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 6-8 weeks from start  
**Completed**: 2 weeks (PoC)  
**Remaining**: 4-6 weeks (Production)

## Technical Decisions Made

### PoC Phase:
1. **Simplified markers**: `<MACRO_START>` without macro names (for speed)
2. **Limited context**: Only task/function/procedural state
3. **Const-correctness hack**: `const_cast` in `InterpretToken()` (noted for refactor)

### Production Phase:
1. **Full markers**: `<MACRO_START:name>` with macro names (for debugging)
2. **Full context**: All parser state saved/restored
3. **Config flag**: `inject_macro_markers` to enable/disable feature
4. **Refactor const**: Make `InterpretToken()` non-const or use mutable members

## Code Quality Commitments

✅ **TDD Methodology**: Tests first, implementation second, always GREEN before move on  
✅ **No Hurry**: Take time to do it right, debug thoroughly  
✅ **No Skip**: Address all issues, no shortcuts or workarounds  
✅ **Perfection = 100%**: All tests must pass, no compromises  
✅ **Documentation**: Inline comments, completion reports, user guides  
✅ **Performance**: <5% overhead, efficient implementation  
✅ **Maintainability**: Clean code, clear abstractions, good naming

## Philosophy

Following the user's guidance:
- **No hurry**: We're taking the time to do this right
- **No skip**: Every test must pass, every edge case handled
- **TDD**: Write tests first, let them guide implementation
- **Perfection = 100%**: Aiming for 100% test pass rate, 100% OpenTitan success

We're building production-grade software, not quick hacks. Quality over speed, but with steady progress every day.

**Status**: Week 5 Day 1 - On track for full production implementation! 🚀
