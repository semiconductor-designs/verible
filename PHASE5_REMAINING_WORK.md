**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated ROI**: High (small investment, big UX improvement)

### 4. Documentation Enhancement (1-2 hours) 📚
**Current**: Technical docs complete
**Missing**:
- User guide with examples
- Tutorial for each tool
- Best practices guide
- Known limitations guide
- API documentation for library use

**Why Important**:
- Easier adoption
- Fewer support questions
- Professional appearance

**Priority**: High (if releasing to users)
**Estimated ROI**: High (documentation is critical for adoption)

### 5. Additional Edge Cases for Operations (2-3 hours) 🧪
**Current**: 16 integration tests for ExtractVariable
**Missing**: Comprehensive edge cases for other operations

**What to Add**:
- ExtractFunction edge cases (10+ tests)
- InlineFunction edge cases (10+ tests)
- MoveDeclaration edge cases (10+ tests)
- Stress tests for all operations

**Why Important**:
- Catch more bugs before production
- Higher confidence
- Better reliability

**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated ROI**: High (TDD approach, high quality)
