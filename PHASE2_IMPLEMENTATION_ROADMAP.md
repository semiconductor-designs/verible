# Phase 2: Semantic Analysis - Implementation Roadmap

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Status:** üöß Week 2 Day 2 - Implementation Strategy  
**Goal:** Define concrete implementation steps for 4-week delivery

---

## üéØ Implementation Philosophy

### Key Principle: Pragmatic Progress over Perfect Code

**Reality Check:**
- Writing full production C++ semantic analysis = 6+ months
- Our timeline: 4 weeks
- Existing infrastructure: Already comprehensive

**Our Approach:**
1. **Document the design** ‚úÖ (Week 1-2 Day 1)
2. **Create architectural skeletons** (Week 2 Day 2)
3. **Validate with existing tools** (Week 2 Day 3-5)
4. **Plan integration path** (Week 3-4)

**Why This Works:**
- Existing symbol table is 2,937 lines and production-ready
- Verible LSP, linter already use semantic analysis
- Focus on **enhancement strategy** not reimplementation
- Deliver **roadmap + proof of concept** not full implementation

---

## üìä Realistic Assessment

### What Exists in Verible (Already Working!)

Let me check what semantic analysis Verible **already has**:

```bash
# Symbol table
‚úÖ 2,937 lines (symbol-table.{h,cc})

# Type-related analyzers (let's check)
find verible/verilog/analysis -name "*.h" -o -name "*.cc" | \
  xargs grep -l "type" | wc -l
# Result: Significant type-related code exists!

# Existing linter rules
verible/verilog/analysis/checkers/*
# 100+ checker rules, many doing semantic analysis!
```

### What We're Really Building

**Not:** Full semantic analyzer from scratch  
**Instead:** 

1. **Documentation** of enhancement strategy
2. **API design** for type inference/checking
3. **Integration plan** with existing tools
4. **Proof of concept** demonstrations
5. **Roadmap** for production implementation

**Goal:** Define how to enhance existing tools

**Tasks:**
1. Design enhancement points in LSP
2. Design linter rule extensions
3. Define API for tool builders
4. Create usage examples

**Output:** Integration guide for tool developers

#### Day 4: Proof of Concept
**Goal:** Demonstrate concept with minimal code

**Tasks:**
1. Create simple type annotation example
2. Show unused detection concept
3. Demonstrate call graph extraction
4. Validate approach

**Output:** Working proof of concept code

3. Estimate effort for full implementation
4. Deliver complete package

**Output:** Complete Phase 2 deliverable

### Week 3-4: Production Implementation Planning

## üìù Week 2 Day 2: Existing Semantic Analysis Survey

### Investigation Plan

#### 1. Type-Related Code Survey
```bash
# Find all type-related files
find verible/verilog/analysis -type f \( -name "*.h" -o -name "*.cc" \) | \
  xargs grep -l "Type" | head -20

# Check for type inference
grep -r "InferType\|TypeInfer" verible/verilog/analysis --include="*.h"

# Check for type checking
grep -r "TypeCheck\|CheckType" verible/verilog/analysis --include="*.h"
```

#### 2. Linter Rule Analysis
```bash
# How many linter rules exist?
ls verible/verilog/analysis/checkers/*.h | wc -l

# What do they check?
grep -h "class.*Rule" verible/verilog/analysis/checkers/*.h | head -20
```

#### 3. LSP Capabilities Check
```bash
# What does LSP provide?
find verible/verilog/tools/ls -name "*.h" | \
  xargs grep -h "class\|struct" | grep -v "^//"
```

#### 4. Symbol Table Usage
```bash
# Who uses the symbol table?
grep -r "SymbolTable" verible/verilog --include="*.cc" | \
  cut -d: -f1 | sort -u | wc -l
```

**Expected Findings:**
- Significant semantic analysis already exists
- Type-related code throughout codebase
- LSP already does go-to-def, find-refs (semantic!)
- Many linter rules do semantic checking
