## Critical Discovery: Scope Complexity

### Original Plan Assumption
The plan stated "15 rules, 30+ tests, 3 auto-fix generators" for Week 1 (12-15 hours).

### Reality Check
Implementing **full CDC/Clock/Reset detection** requires:

1. **CST Traversal Infrastructure**
   - Find all `always_ff` blocks in parsed code
   - Extract clock signals from sensitivity lists (`@(posedge clk)`)
   - Identify all signal assignments within blocks
   - Track signal uses across different blocks

2. **Clock Domain Analysis**
   - Map each signal to its originating clock domain
   - Detect when signals cross clock domains
   - Identify synchronizer patterns (2+ stage FF chains)
   - Handle complex cases (clock muxes, gated clocks)

3. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Track signal propagation through CST
   - Identify signal reads vs writes
   - Handle hierarchical signal references
   - Detect combinational loops

4. **Reset Analysis**
   - Identify reset signals from sensitivity lists
   - Verify reset presence in sequential logic
   - Check reset polarity consistency
   - Validate asynchronous reset synchronization

5. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Parse SystemVerilog code for testing
   - Build symbol tables from parsed code
   - Verify detection of actual violations
   - Test negative cases (valid code)

### Estimated Actual Effort

For **FULL implementation** of 15 rules with real detection:

| Component | Original Estimate | Realistic Estimate |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CDC rules (4) | 4-5 hours | 15-20 hours |
| Clock rules (4) | 3-4 hours | 10-15 hours |
| Reset rules (5) | 4-5 hours | 12-18 hours |
| Timing rules (2) | 1-2 hours | 8-12 hours |
| **Total** | **12-15 hours** | **45-65 hours** |

**Gap**: 3-4x more work than originally estimated!

## Three Path Options

### Option A: Framework Approach (Current)
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Time Spent**: 2 hours  
**What We Have**:
- Complete type system for all 15 rules
- Method signatures in place
- Framework tests passing
- Ready for incremental implementation

**What's Missing**:
- Actual CST-based violation detection
- Real test cases with parsed code
- Auto-fix generators

**Pros**:
- Moves to Week 2 on schedule
- Foundation is solid
- Can circle back later

**Cons**:
- Rules are placeholders
- Not production-ready for CDC detection

---

### Option B: Single Rule Deep Dive
**Scope**: Fully implement **ONE** rule (e.g., CDC_001)  
**Time Estimate**: 12-15 hours  
**Deliverables**:
- Complete CDC_001 implementation
- CST traversal infrastructure
- 10+ real test cases
- Auto-fix generator
- Can be template for other 14 rules

**Pros**:
- One rule is 100% production-ready
- Proves the approach works
- Reusable infrastructure for others

**Cons**:
- Only 1/15 rules complete
- Week 1 takes 3-4 weeks

---

### Option C: Comprehensive Implementation
**Scope**: Full implementation of all 15 rules as originally planned  
**Time Estimate**: 45-65 hours (3-5 weeks)  
**Deliverables**:
- All 15 rules production-ready
- 30+ comprehensive tests
- 3 auto-fix generators
- Complete CDC/Clock/Reset validation

**Pros**:
- Achieves original Week 1 goals
- Production-ready validation
- VeriPG can use immediately

**Cons**:
- Requires 3-5 weeks instead of 1 week
- Delays Week 2-6
- Total Phase 6 timeline extends to 10-12 weeks

---

## Recommendation

Given user preferences:
- **1B**: Primary goal = Support VeriPG better
- **2A**: Timeline = No rush, quality over speed
- **3C**: Success metric = Feature completeness

I recommend **Option C: Comprehensive Implementation**.

### Why?
1. **Quality over speed** (user's explicit choice)
2. **Feature completeness** is the success metric
3. **No hurry** means we can take the time needed
4. **VeriPG needs real validation**, not just a framework

### Adjusted Timeline

**Phase 6 Revised**:
- Week 1: CDC/Clock/Reset (4-5 weeks actual) ← We are here
- Week 2: Naming & Width (2-3 weeks)
- Week 3: Power/Structure (2-3 weeks)
- Week 4: Config/AutoFix (1-2 weeks)
- Week 5: Performance (1-2 weeks)
- Week 6: Docs/Release (1-2 weeks)

**Total**: 11-17 weeks (vs original 4-6 weeks)

**Still achieves**: 50+ rules, 150+ tests, production quality

## Current Status Summary

### Completed (2 hours)
- ✅ Framework infrastructure
- ✅ Type definitions (Severity, RuleId, Violation)
- ✅ Method signatures
- ✅ 7 framework tests
- ✅ All tests passing (32/32)

### Pending (43-63 hours for Option C)
- ⏳ CST traversal infrastructure
- ⏳ Clock domain analysis
- ⏳ Synchronizer pattern detection
- ⏳ 15 rule implementations
- ⏳ 23+ additional tests
- ⏳ 3 auto-fix generators

## Question for User

Which option do you prefer?

**A.** Accept framework, move to Week 2 (stay on 4-6 week timeline)  
**B.** Deep dive on CDC_001 only (1 complete rule, 3-4 weeks)  
**C.** Full implementation of all 15 rules (production-ready, 4-5 weeks for Week 1)

**My recommendation**: **C** (aligns with "no hurry, quality, feature completeness")

---

**Next Steps (pending your choice)**:
- If A: Move to Week 2 (Naming & Width rules)
- If B: Implement CDC_001 fully with CST traversal
- If C: Implement all 15 rules comprehensively

**Current Git Status**: Framework committed and pushed to master ✅
