# Current Session Status

**Date**: 2025-03-14  
**Current Focus**: Fix deep nesting issue (NO KNOWN ISSUES goal)

---

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. Include File Support (v5.3.0) - COMPLETE
- ✅ 10/10 unit tests passing
- ✅ Performance better than baseline (-16.66%)
- ✅ All risks mitigated
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Ready for release

### 2. UVM Week 17 - Type Parameters
- ✅ 10/10 type parameter tests created
- ✅ All tests PASSED immediately
- ✅ Verible already supports type parameters fully
- ✅ Phase 4 effectively complete (no implementation needed)

### 3. Critical Analysis
- ✅ Identified that "incredible moments" need scrutiny
- ✅ Verified type parameters are NOT the issue  
- ✅ Confirmed 14 OpenTitan failures are due to deep nesting
- ✅ User directive: "we shouldn't have any known issue"

## 🎯 Current Task

### Fix Deep Nesting Issue

**Goal**: 100% OpenTitan (2,108/2,108)

**Current**: 2,094/2,108 (99.3%)  
**Remaining**: 14 files (0.7%) fail due to deep nesting

**Root Cause**: Include files 3+ levels deep don't propagate macros

---

## 📋 Implementation Plan

1. ⏸️ Create deep nesting tests (TDD Red)
2. ⏸️ Implement recursive preprocessing
3. ⏸️ Integrate with include handler
4. ⏸️ Update IncludeFileResolver
5. ⏸️ OpenTitan validation (100%)

**Estimated**: 9-13 hours (1-2 days)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ All deep nesting tests pass
- ✅ OpenTitan: 2,108/2,108 (100%)
- ✅ Zero regressions
- ✅ Performance maintained

---

## 📊 Overall Project Status

### Verible v5.3.0:
- ✅ Include support complete
- ⏸️ Deep nesting fix in progress

### UVM Enhancement:
- ✅ Phases 1-3: COMPLETE (99.3% OpenTitan)
- ✅ Phase 4: Analysis complete (type params work)
- ⏸️ Phases 5-10: TBD

**Status**: Working on deep nesting fix  
**Next**: Implement recursive preprocessing  
**Goal**: NO KNOWN ISSUES ✅
