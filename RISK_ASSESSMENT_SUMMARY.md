   - Clean resource management

3. **Code Quality**
   - Consistent style and naming
   - Good documentation
   - Clear error handling with absl::Status

4. **Performance**

   - Future: Consider `std::unique_ptr` for better exception safety

2. **Return by Reference** (Low Priority)
   - Current: Query methods copy vectors
   - Future: Return `const std::vector&` for large results

3. **CST Traversal Implementation** (Feature Addition)
   - Current: Call site extraction stubbed
   - Future: Implement for complete functionality

4. **API Documentation** (Low Priority)
   - Current: Good inline comments
   - Future: Add more detailed API docs for stub methods

5. **Pattern Matching Enhancement** (Low Priority)
   - Current: Simple substring matching
   - Future: Consider regex support for patterns

## Issues Fixed During Review

### 🟢 **Recursion Counter Bug** - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: Statistics overcounting recursive functions when nodes appear in multiple cycles

**Fix Applied**:
```cpp
// Before:
void MarkRecursiveCycle(const std::vector<CallGraphNode*>& cycle) {
  for (auto* node : cycle) {
    node->is_recursive = true;
    statistics_.recursive_functions++;  // ← Always increments
  }
}

// After:
void MarkRecursiveCycle(const std::vector<CallGraphNode*>& cycle) {
  for (auto* node : cycle) {
    if (!node->is_recursive) {  // ← Check first
      node->is_recursive = true;
      statistics_.recursive_functions++;
    }
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Statistics now accurately reflect unique recursive functions  
**Testing**: All tests still pass (21/21)  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved
