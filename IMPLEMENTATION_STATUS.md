# Implementation Status - Phase A Type Resolution

## Current Status: Re-implementing from scratch

**What Happened:**
- Phase A typedef resolution was implemented in memory but never committed
- Git checkout removed all uncommitted changes
- Test suite exists (15 tests), but implementation is lost

**Recovery Plan:**
1. Re-implement Phase A cleanly (all 15 tests)
2. Commit immediately after each milestone
3. Continue to Phase B

**Timeline:**
- Re-implementation: ~2 hours (faster with clear plan)
- Test pass: Target 15/15 (100%)
- Commit strategy: Commit after every passing test group

**Current Branch:** `veripg/phases-9-22-enhancements`

**Next Steps:**
1. Add TypedefInfo struct
2. Implement BuildTypedefTable with location tracking
3. Implement AddTypeResolutionMetadata
4. Add package symbol table support
5. Test and commit

---

**Lesson Learned:** Commit early and often, especially for large implementations.
