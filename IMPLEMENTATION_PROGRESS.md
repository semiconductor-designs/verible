# Implementation Progress Tracker

**Started**: October 17, 2025  
**Mode**: Continuous until next week  
**Goal**: 100% quality, TDD approach

## Current Focus: InterfaceValidator Implementation

### Status: IN PROGRESS

#### What's Done âœ…
1. Test infrastructure (12 test files)
2. Complete header file (270+ lines)
3. Test framework (455+ lines)
4. Basic traversal skeleton
5. Signal extraction (basic)
6. Build system integration

#### What's Being Implemented ðŸš§
1. Interface extraction using CST utilities
2. Modport parsing
3. Connection detection
4. Validation logic

#### Discovered Resources
- `FindAllInterfaceDeclarations()` - CST utility
- `GetInterfaceHeader()` - Extract interface header
- Module.h has interface utilities
- Can leverage similar patterns from PortConnectionValidator

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Interface Extraction
- [ ] Use FindAllInterfaceDeclarations from CST
- [ ] Extract interface names
- [ ] Extract signals properly
- [ ] Store in interfaces_ map
- [ ] Verify with debug output

### Phase 2: Modport Support
- [ ] Research modport CST structure
- [ ] Implement modport extraction
- [ ] Parse signal directions
- [ ] Store in ModportInfo

### Phase 3: Connection Validation
- [ ] Detect interface port usage
- [ ] Link instances to definitions
- [ ] Validate connections
- [ ] Check modport usage

### Phase 4: Error Detection
- [ ] Implement direction checking
- [ ] Detect missing modports
- [ ] Report clear errors
- [ ] Get error tests passing

## Working Notes

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Add CST module.h includes
2. Use FindAllInterfaceDeclarations in ExtractInterfaces
3. Test if interfaces are found
4. Iterate and refine

### Key Patterns to Follow:
- Port-connection-validator CST usage
- Multi-file-resolver symbol table traversal
- Clean error reporting
