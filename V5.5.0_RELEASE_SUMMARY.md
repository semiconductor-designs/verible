  - Arrow token disambiguation statistics
  - Parse timing (total, average, per-file)
  - Error pattern categorization

#### 1.2 Error Pattern Detection
- **Categories tracked**:
  - `arrow_syntax_error`: Event trigger operator issues
  - `general_syntax_error`: Other syntax problems
  - `include_not_found`: Missing include files
  - `macro_error`: Macro-related issues
  - `other_error`: Unclassified errors

#### 1.3 Performance Tracking

  ```
  === Parse Statistics ===
  Total files: 18
  Successful: 18 (100.0%)
  Failed: 0 (0.0%)
  
  Parse timing:
    Total: 45ms
    Average: 2ms per file
  ========================
  ```

### Phase 4: Long-term Planning ✅

**Objective**: Design future improvements for macro-aware context tracking

#### 4.1 Macro Context Design
- **File**: `docs/MACRO_CONTEXT_DESIGN.md` (New)
- **Contents**:
  - Problem statement: Context loss after macro expansion
  - Current workaround: Heuristic approach (v5.4.2)
  - Three proposed solutions:
    1. **Option 1: Macro Boundary Markers** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
       - Inject special tokens at macro boundaries
       - Preserve context through expansion
       - Effort: 2-3 weeks, Risk: Medium
    2. **Option 2: Context Stack**
       - Maintain explicit context stack
       - Effort: 3-4 weeks, Risk: Medium-High
    3. **Option 3: Two-Pass Preprocessing**
       - Separate preprocessing and parsing
       - Effort: 4-6 weeks, Risk: High
  - Alternative: Enhanced heuristic with multi-token lookahead
  - Timeline: v5.6.0 (medium-term), v6.0 (long-term)
  - Success criteria and risk mitigation

#### 4.2 Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Proof of Concept (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Full Implementation (Week 2)
- **Phase 3**: Testing and Refinement (Week 3)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Release (Week 4+)
