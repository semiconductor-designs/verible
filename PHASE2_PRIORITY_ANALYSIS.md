## üìä Detailed Priority Breakdown

### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê TypeInference (5 Stars) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Why 5 Stars:**

1. **Foundational** - Everything else builds on it
   - TypeChecker needs TypeInference
   - Linter rules need type info
   - LSP features need types
   - UnusedDetector could use it

2. **Broad Impact** - Benefits all users
   - Every linter rule can query types
   - Every tool gets consistent type info
   - LSP gets better hover/completion
   - Formatters get type context

3. **Current Gap is Large** - No unified system exists
   - Each rule extracts types ad-hoc
   - Inconsistent results
   - Duplicated code
   - No caching

4. **User Demand is High** - Users frequently ask:
   - "Why doesn't the linter catch type errors?"
   - "Why is type info inconsistent?"
   - "Can LSP show type on hover?"

**Impact:** Enables all other semantic features

## üéØ Should They All Be 5 Stars?

### Two Perspectives

#### Perspective A: "All Are Valuable" ‚úÖ
**Argument:** All four enhancements provide real value!
- They're all well-designed
- They all fill gaps
- They all benefit users
- They should all be implemented

**Counter:** Yes, but in what order?

#### Perspective B: "Prioritize by Impact" ‚úÖ (Current)
**Argument:** Stars reflect implementation priority
- 5 stars = Do this first (foundational)
- 4 stars = Do next (high value)
- 3 stars = Do later (nice to have)

**This helps decide order when resources are limited**

---

## üí° Alternative Rating System

### If We Rate by "Should We Implement?"

| Enhancement | Should Implement? | When? |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| TypeInference | ‚úÖ YES - ESSENTIAL | Week 1-4 |
| UnusedDetector | ‚úÖ YES - HIGH VALUE | Week 5-6 |
| TypeChecker | ‚úÖ YES - HIGH VALUE | Week 7-9 |
| CallGraph | ‚úÖ YES - GOOD TO HAVE | Week 10-11 |

**All are "Yes" - just different timing!**

---

## üìã What's Pending? (Current Status)

### Phase 2: Design Phase

**Week 1:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Understanding)
**Week 2:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Design & Roadmap)
**Week 3-4:** üìÖ OPTIONAL (Begin implementation or conclude design phase)

### Phase 3: Implementation Phase (PENDING)

**Status:** NOT STARTED

**What's Pending:**
```
Week 1-4:   TypeInference       [                    ] 0%
Week 5-6:   UnusedDetector      [                    ] 0%
Week 7-9:   TypeChecker         [                    ] 0%
Week 10-11: CallGraph           [                    ] 0%
```

**Total Pending:** 8-11 weeks of implementation

---

## üöÄ What Needs to Happen Next

### Option A: Start Implementation Now

**Begin TypeInference Week 1:**
```bash
# Create files
touch verible/verilog/analysis/type-representation.h
touch verible/verilog/analysis/type-representation.cc
touch verible/verilog/analysis/type-representation_test.cc

# Start coding
# Day 1-2: Type class
# Day 3-4: TypeInference skeleton
# Day 5: Basic tests
```

**Timeline:** 11 weeks to complete all four

---

### Option B: Prioritize Subset (Recommended)

**Implement High-Value Only:**
- Week 1-4: TypeInference (5 stars) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Week 5-6: UnusedDetector (4 stars) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- SKIP: TypeChecker (4 stars) - for later
- SKIP: CallGraph (3 stars) - for later

**Timeline:** 6 weeks for maximum value
**Coverage:** 80% of user value in 50% of time

---

### Option C: Wait for Right Time

**Archive design, implement later:**
- All documentation complete (6,907 lines)
- Clear roadmap exists
- Can start anytime
- Implement when priority aligns

**Timeline:** TBD based on priorities

---
