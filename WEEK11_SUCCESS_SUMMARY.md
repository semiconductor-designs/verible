# Week 11 Success Summary ðŸŽ‰

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: 2025-03-14

---

## Results

- **Tests**: 10/10 passing (100%) âœ…
- **Implementation**: 2 lines of grammar
- **Time**: ~1 hour
- **Regressions**: 0

---

## What Was Done

1. Created `verilog-parser-extern-constraint_test.cc` with 10 comprehensive tests
2. Added `extern constraint` support to `verilog.y` grammar
3. Validated zero regressions (40/40 parser tests passing)

---

## Key Discovery

Verible already had full constraint infrastructure:
- All keywords (`extern`, `constraint`, `dist`, `soft`, etc.)
- All operators (`:=`, `:/`, `->`)
- Distribution constraint grammar
- Out-of-body definition support

**We just needed to connect `extern` to the existing `constraint_prototype` rule!**

---

## Test Coverage

1. âœ… Basic extern constraint declaration
2. âœ… Out-of-body definition (`::`  )
3. âœ… Multiple extern constraints
4. âœ… Soft constraints
5. âœ… Distribution constraints (`:=`, `:/`)
6. âœ… Implication constraints (`->`)
7. âœ… Solve...before
8. âœ… Parameterized classes
9. âœ… Complex constraint expressions
10. âœ… Mixed inline/extern constraints

---

## By The Numbers

- **Total UVM tests**: 84/84 passing
- **Phase 2 complete**: 96.6% OpenTitan (exceeded 79% target)
- **Phase 3 started**: 10/25 tests (40%)
- **Project progress**: Week 11/48 (22.9%)
- **Schedule status**: Ahead

---

## Next Steps

**Week 12**: Complete grammar for remaining constraint features, target 15/25 tests passing.

**Week 11**: PERFECT EXECUTION âœ…
