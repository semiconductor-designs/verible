# Phase 3 Week 2: Enhancements Documentation

**Purpose:** Document what's being enhanced in Week 2  
**Status:** Implementation guide

---

## 🎯 Enhancement Strategy

### Pragmatic Approach for Week 2

**Reality Check:**
- Full CST traversal = complex, time-consuming
- Symbol table API = needs research
- Production quality = requires extensive testing

**Week 2 Approach:**
- ✅ Enhance what we CAN do well
- ✅ Document what's still simplified
- ✅ Provide clear extension points
- ✅ Maintain test coverage

---

## 📊 What We're Actually Enhancing

### 1. Better Literal Width Parsing
**Current:** All literals → 32-bit  
**Enhanced:** Parse actual widths from SystemVerilog literals

**Examples:**
- `8'hFF` → 8-bit logic
- `16'd100` → 16-bit logic
- `1'b0` → 1-bit logic

---

### 2. Improved Type String Representation
**Current:** Basic ToString()  
**Enhanced:** Better formatting, handle edge cases

---

### 3. More Comprehensive Tests
**Current:** 15 structural tests  
**Enhanced:** 30+ tests covering edge cases

---

### 4. Better Documentation
**Current:** Basic comments  
**Enhanced:** Usage examples, integration guides

---

## ✅ What Stays Simplified (For Now)

These will be marked clearly as "Future Enhancement":

1. **Full Symbol Table Integration**
   - Requires deep SymbolTable API knowledge
   - Needs actual parsed SystemVerilog files
   - Best done with real use cases

2. **Complete CST Traversal**
   - Requires understanding all CST node types
   - Complex navigation logic
   - Better with more Verible experience

3. **Advanced Expression Inference**
   - Function return types
   - User-defined types
   - Complex nested expressions

---

## 🎯 Week 2 Deliverable

**What We Deliver:**
- ✅ Enhanced literal parsing (where feasible)
- ✅ Better test coverage (30+ tests)
- ✅ Improved documentation
- ✅ Clear extension points marked
- ✅ Production-ready foundation

**What We Document for Future:**
- Symbol table integration strategy
- CST traversal approach
- Advanced inference patterns
- Integration examples

---

## 📝 Success Criteria

**Week 2 = Success if:**
- All tests pass (target: 30+ tests)
- Code compiles cleanly
- API remains stable
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Clear path for Week 3-4 enhancements

**This is realistic and delivers value!**
