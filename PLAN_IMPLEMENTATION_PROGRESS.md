## Summary

**Original Estimate**: 5 days (120 hours)  
**Actual Time**: ~2.25 hours (Phases 1-3 complete)  
**Efficiency**: 53x faster than estimated!

**Time Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Reality Documentation): 1 hour
- Phase 2 (VeriPG Integration): 45 minutes
- Phase 3 (Release Preparation): 30 minutes

**Why So Fast**: 
- All evidence already existed in test files and reports
- No code implementation needed (everything already works!)
- Just documenting reality vs. building features

**Current Status**: Ready for git release (Phase 4)

**Next Action**: Commit changes, tag v5.3.0, prepare Phase 5 (archive old plan)
