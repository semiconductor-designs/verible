## 🎯 What's Done

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Test infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- ✅ **Phase 2.1**: UVM Macro Registry (Week 3)
  - 29 UVM macros defined
  - 15/15 unit tests passing (100%)
  - Clean build, excellent docs

## 🔄 What's Next (Week 4)

**Phase 2.2: Preprocessor Integration**

**Goal**: Make UVM macros usable by integrating into `verilog-preprocess.cc`

**Key Tasks**:
1. Add `#include "uvm-macros.h"`
2. Implement `LookupUVMMacro()` helper
3. Integrate into macro lookup flow
4. Create 4 integration tests
5. Verify no regressions

**Timeline**: 5 days

# Verify Phase 2.1 is still working
cd /Users/jonguksong/Projects/verible
bazel test //verible/verilog/preprocessor:uvm-macros_test

# Expected: PASSED in 0.3s, [  PASSED  ] 15 tests
```
