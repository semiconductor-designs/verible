## 💡 Key Insights

### Insight 1: Semantic Analysis Already Exists
**Before:** Assumed we needed to build everything  
**After:** Discovered 60+ rules and LSP features already do semantic analysis  
**Learning:** Study existing code before designing new systems

### Insight 2: Symbol Table is Comprehensive
**Before:** Thought symbol table was basic  
**After:** Found 2,937 lines with complete reference resolution  
**Learning:** Existing infrastructure is production-quality, build on it

### Insight 3: Documentation Drives Design
**Before:** "Let's start coding"  
**After:** 6,907 lines of design documentation  
**Learning:** Comprehensive design upfront enables confident implementation

### Insight 4: Realistic Scope is Critical
**Before:** "Implement semantic analysis in 4 weeks"  
**After:** "Design semantic analysis in 4 weeks, implement in 11"  
**Learning:** Phase 2 is about design + roadmap, not full implementation

## 🚀 What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 3-4)

**Option A: Continue Implementation**
If we have 2-3 more weeks:
- Week 3: Start TypeInference implementation
