# Phase 6 Week 1: CDC Detection - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH! üéâ

## Achievement Summary
**ALL 4 CDC INTEGRATION TESTS PASS! ‚úÖ**

After 26 hours of systematic TDD debugging, we successfully implemented working CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) detection in the VeriPG Validator.

## Test Results
```
‚úÖ DetectCDCViolationNoSync (2 ms) - PASSED
‚úÖ ValidCDCWithSynchronizer (1 ms) - PASSED  
‚úÖ SameDomainNoCDC (0 ms) - PASSED
‚úÖ MultipleViolations (1 ms) - PASSED

Total: 4/4 tests passing (100%)
```

## The Bug: A Classic TDD Case Study

### Problem Discovered (Hour 20-22)
Using diagnostic unit tests, we printed the actual CST structure and revealed:
```
[CDC DEBUG] Clock extracted: 'clk_a'
[CDC DEBUG] Assigned signals: 1
[CDC DEBUG]   data_a -> clk_a

[CDC DEBUG] Clock extracted: 'clk_b'
[CDC DEBUG] Assigned signals: 2
[CDC DEBUG]   data_b -> clk_b
[CDC DEBUG]   data_a -> clk_b  ‚ùå BUG! data_a is RHS, not LHS!
```

For the assignment `data_b <= data_a;`:
- **Expected**: Only `data_b` (LHS) should be marked as "assigned"
- **Actual**: BOTH `data_b` AND `data_a` were marked as "assigned"

### Root Cause (Hour 22-24)
`GetAssignedSignalsInBlock()` was naively traversing the entire assignment node, including both LHS (target) and RHS (source). This caused signals used on the RHS to be incorrectly classified as "assigned".

### The Fix (Hour 24-26)
Used Verible's built-in CST helper:
```cpp
// Before: Naive traversal of entire assignment
for (const auto& assignment : assignments) {
  extract_lhs(*assignment.match);  // ‚ùå Traverses BOTH LHS and RHS!
}

// After: Use proper CST API
const auto* lhs = verilog::GetNonBlockingAssignmentLhs(*assignment_node);  // ‚úÖ LHS only!
extract_lhs_identifiers(*lhs);
```

**Assignment Structure in Verible CST:**
- `Child[0]` = LHS (what's being assigned)
- `Child[1]` = Assignment operator (`<=`)
- `Child[3]` = RHS (what's being read/used)

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
1. **veripg-validator.cc**
   - Fixed `GetAssignedSignalsInBlock()` to use `GetNonBlockingAssignmentLhs()`
   - Implemented `CheckCDCViolations()` with proper clock domain tracking
   - Implemented 3 helper functions: `ExtractClockFromBlock`, `GetUsedSignalsInBlock`, `HasSynchronizerPattern`

2. **veripg-validator_cdc_unit_test.cc** (NEW)
   - Diagnostic tests that revealed CST structure
   - Tests for finding always_ff blocks
   - CST visualization tests

3. **veripg-validator_cdc_integration_test.cc** (NEW)
   - 4 end-to-end tests with real SystemVerilog files
   - Test files in `testdata/cdc/`

4. **BUILD**
   - Added unit and integration test targets

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 4 diagnostic tests (CST structure verification)
- **Integration Tests**: 4 end-to-end tests (actual violation detection)
- **Test Files**: 4 SystemVerilog test cases covering various CDC scenarios

### CDC Detection Algorithm
```
1. Find all always_ff blocks in the design
2. Extract clock signal from each block's sensitivity list
3. Map all assigned signals to their clock domains
4. For each block, check used signals:
   - If a signal is from a different domain ‚Üí CDC violation
   - If a 2-stage synchronizer exists ‚Üí Valid CDC
   - If same domain ‚Üí No violation
```

## TDD Methodology Success

### Timeline
1. **Hours 0-12**: Initial implementation of helper functions
2. **Hours 12-16**: Integration test setup
3. **Hours 16-20**: Debugging why tests return 0 violations
4. **Hours 20-22**: Created diagnostic unit tests
5. **Hours 22-24**: CST structure revealed, bug identified
6. **Hours 24-26**: Fix implemented, all tests passing!

### Key TDD Principles Applied
1. ‚úÖ **Write failing tests first** - Integration tests revealed the bug
2. ‚úÖ **Add diagnostic tests** - Unit tests printed CST structure
3. ‚úÖ **Systematic debugging** - Added debug logging to identify exact issue
4. ‚úÖ **Use proper APIs** - Discovered `GetNonBlockingAssignmentLhs()`
5. ‚úÖ **Verify fix** - All tests green before committing

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **CST Visualization** - Printing the actual tree structure was critical
2. **Debug Logging** - Seeing actual vs expected data revealed the bug immediately
3. **Verible's Built-in Helpers** - Using `GetNonBlockingAssignmentLhs()` instead of manual traversal
4. **Incremental Testing** - Unit tests ‚Üí Integration tests ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Fix

### What Didn't Work
1. ‚ùå Naive CST traversal (traversing entire node instead of specific children)
2. ‚ùå Assuming child[0..3] limit would avoid RHS (it didn't)
3. ‚ùå Not checking Verible's existing CST helpers first

### Best Practices Confirmed
- Always use Verible's built-in CST helpers when available
- Print actual CST structure when debugging node traversal
- Add extensive debug logging during development
- Write diagnostic unit tests when integration tests fail

## Current Status: Week 1 Progress

### Completed (26 hours)
- ‚úÖ CDC_001: CDC without synchronizer (fully working!)
- ‚úÖ Test infrastructure (4 unit + 4 integration tests)
- ‚úÖ Helper functions (4/4 working correctly)
- ‚úÖ CST traversal (proper API usage)

### Remaining (Est. 9 hours)
- ‚è≥ CDC_002: Multi-bit CDC (2h)
- ‚è≥ CDC_003: Clock mux detection (2h)
- ‚è≥ CDC_004: Async reset crossing (2h)
- ‚è≥ CLK_001-004: Clock rules (framework exists, needs logic) (1h)
- ‚è≥ RST_001-005: Reset rules (framework exists, needs logic) (1h)
- ‚è≥ Documentation (1h)

**Total Progress: 26/35 hours (74% complete)**

## Performance Metrics
- **Build time**: ~2-6 seconds
- **Test execution**: 4-6 ms total for all 4 integration tests
- **Memory**: No issues
- **Test files parsed**: 4 SystemVerilog files

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining CDC rules (CDC_002-004)
2. Implement actual logic for CLK and RST rules
3. Add comprehensive documentation
4. Create Week 1 completion report
5. Move to Week 2 (Naming & Width rules)

## Quote
> "After 26 hours of systematic debugging using TDD methodology, we achieved 100% test success. The bug was subtle (LHS vs RHS confusion), but our diagnostic approach with CST visualization made it trivial to identify and fix. This is TDD at its best!"
