# Release v4.0.1 - Phase 40 `let` Support + M3 TRUE 100%

**Release Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Tag:** v4.0.1  
**Commit:** 47552f1f

---

## 🎉 Major Highlights

### 1. ✅ Phase 40 COMPLETE: `let` Keyword Support
**VeriPG Phase 40 is now UNBLOCKED!**

Full support for `let` declarations in SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA):
- ✅ **Properties:** Full support
- ✅ **Sequences:** Full support
- ✅ **IEEE 1800-2017 Section 16.12 compliant**

```systemverilog
// ✅ NOW WORKS!
property p_test;
  let max(a, b) = (a > b) ? a : b;
  @(posedge clk) (max(x, y) < 10);
endproperty

sequence s;
  let double(x) = x * 2;
  a until b;
endsequence
```

**Impact:**
- VeriPG can now extract `let` declarations from properties and sequences
- All SVA reusable expression patterns supported
- No workarounds needed

---

### 2. ✅ M3 TRUE 100%: Member Capture in Expressions
**NO MORE WORKAROUNDS!**

Full support for member capture in expression contexts:

```systemverilog
// ✅ NOW WORKS! (Previously required case...matches workaround)
if (value matches tagged i .v)
  x = v;

while (data matches tagged Valid .val)
  sum += val;

result = (opt matches tagged Some .v) ? v : 0;
```

**What was fixed:**
- Grammar disambiguation: After `tagged Type`, `.var` can only be capture
- No ambiguity with member access operator
- Zero grammar conflicts

**Coverage:**
- Pattern matching: 53/53 tests (100%)
- Real-world usage: 100% (no workarounds needed)

## 📊 Technical Details

### New Features

#### 1. Phase 40: `let` Keyword (10 new tests)

**Grammar Implementation:**
```yacc
assertion_variable_declaration_list
  : assertion_variable_declaration_list ';' let_identifier_with_arguments
  | let_identifier_with_arguments
  ;

let_identifier_with_arguments
  : TK_let GenericIdentifier let_port_list_in_parens_opt '=' expression
  ;
```

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✅ Basic let in property
2. ✅ Let after variable declaration
3. ✅ Multiple let declarations
4. ✅ Let with no parameters
5. ✅ Let with complex expression
6. ✅ Let in sequence
7. ✅ Let mixed with variables
8. ✅ Let with multiple parameters
9. ✅ Let with logical operations
10. ✅ Let with bit selection

#### 2. M3 Member Capture (10 new tests)

**Grammar Implementation:**
```yacc
expr_pattern
  : TK_tagged GenericIdentifier '.' GenericIdentifier
    /* Tagged union WITH capture: matches tagged Valid .v */
  ;
```

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✅ if statement with capture
2. ✅ while loop with capture
3. ✅ ternary conditional with capture
4. ✅ assertion with capture
5. ✅ compound statements with captures
6. ✅ assignment expression with capture
7. ✅ nested tagged unions with capture
8. ✅ do-while loop with capture
9. ✅ logical AND with capture
10. ✅ logical OR with capture
