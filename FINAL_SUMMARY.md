## What Was Fixed

### Phase 1: CallGraphEnhancer (2 tests)

**1. Call Depth Computation**
- **Issue**: BFS computed depth from entry points downward
- **Fix**: Changed to BFS from leaf nodes upward
- **Insight**: "call_depth" means max path length to leaves, not from entry
- **Result**: Depths now correctly computed (leaf=0, entry=highest)

**2. Unreachable Function Detection**
- **Issue**: All no-caller functions marked as entry points
- **Fix**: Entry points must have callees (participate in graph)
- **Insight**: Orphans (no callers, no callees) are unreachable
- **Result**: Proper distinction between entry points and orphans

---

### Phase 2: DataFlowAnalyzer (4 tests)

**Parameter Extraction (all 4 failures)**
- **Issue**: Parameters not extracted at all (0 found, expected 2)
- **Root Cause**: Parameters NOT in symbol table, must extract from CST
- **Fix**: Extract from module's syntax_origin using FindAllParamDeclarations()
- **Key Insight**: Verible uses two-tier architecture (Symbol Table + CST)
- **Result**: All parameters now correctly extracted and marked as constants

---

## Architecture Discovery

### Verible's Two-Tier Design

**Symbol Table**:
- High-level constructs (modules, classes, functions)
- Named entities with scope
- Fast lookup and cross-reference

**Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)**:
- Complete parse tree
- All syntactic elements (including parameters)
- Detailed extraction via specialized APIs

**Key Learning**: Parameters are CST elements, not symbol table entries!

## Key Insights

### 1. Architecture Understanding Crucial
Learning Verible's two-tier design (Symbol Table + CST) was essential for solving parameter extraction.

### 2. Learn from Existing Code
Studying `parameter-tracker.cc` revealed the correct approach in 30 minutes.

### 3. Semantic vs Algorithmic Correctness
Call depth algorithm was correct, but semantic meaning was inverted.

### 4. Test-Driven Investigation
Tests precisely identified issues and verified fixes.

### 5. Git Special Characters
Avoid %, !, UTF-8 symbols in commit messages (causes hanging).

---

## Git Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Git commands hanging indefinitely

**Cause**: Special characters in commit messages
- Percent signs (%)
- Exclamation marks (!)
- UTF-8 symbols (✅, ✓, 🎉)

**Solution**: Use simple ASCII-only messages
