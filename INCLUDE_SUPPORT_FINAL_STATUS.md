    test_with_include.sv
    
Exit code: 0 ✅ SUCCESS!
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitation

### **Nested Includes Not Fully Supported**

**Issue**: OpenTitan files use deeply nested includes:
```
file.sv includes A.svh
  → A.svh includes B.svh
    → B.svh includes C.svh
      → C.svh defines the macro
```

**Current Behavior**:
- ✅ Direct includes work (file → included file)
- ⚠️ Nested includes partially work
- ❌ Deep nesting may not resolve all macros

**Root Cause**: The preprocessor processes includes sequentially but doesn't fully recursively expand nested include chains before expanding macros.

**Example**:
```bash
# OpenTitan test:
$ verible-verilog-syntax \
    --include_paths=hw/dv/sv/dv_utils \
    --preprocess=true \
    cip_base_env_cfg.sv

Error: "`DV_COMMON_CLK_CONSTRAINT" : Error expanding macro identifier
```

**Why**: The macro is defined in `dv_macros.svh`, but it's included through intermediate files, and the preprocessor doesn't recursively expand deeply enough.

---

## 💡 What This Means

### **What Works** ✅:

1. **Simple Includes**: File directly includes header with macros
   ```systemverilog
   // main.sv
   `include "macros.svh"  // ← Works!
   `MY_MACRO(x)
   ```

2. **Two-Level Includes**: File includes file that includes macros
   ```systemverilog
   // main.sv
   `include "common.svh"
   
   // common.svh
   `include "macros.svh"  // ← Usually works
   ```

3. **Multiple Include Paths**: Searching multiple directories
   ```bash
   --include_paths=/path1 --include_paths=/path2  # ← Works!
   ```

### **What Doesn't Work** ❌:

1. **Deep Nesting**: 3+ levels of includes with macros used at top level
2. **Complex OpenTitan Files**: Files with deeply nested include hierarchies
3. **The 14 Failing Files**: All have deeply nested includes

---

## 📊 OpenTitan Validation Results

### Current Status:
- **Simple test case**: ✅ PASSING
- **OpenTitan files**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (still 14 failures)
- **Root cause**: Nested include limitation

### Expected vs Actual:
| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Simple includes** | ✅ Work | ✅ Work | SUCCESS |
| **Nested includes** | ✅ Work | ⚠️ Partial | LIMITATION |
| **OpenTitan files** | 100% | 99.3% | SAME |

**Conclusion**: Our implementation works correctly for simple/moderate includes, but OpenTitan's deeply nested structure needs additional work.

---

## 🔧 Technical Analysis

### **Why Nested Includes Are Hard**:

The current preprocessor architecture:
1. Scans token stream
2. When `include found, calls `file_opener`
3. Lexes included file content
4. Returns tokens to main stream
5. **BUT**: Doesn't recursively preprocess the included content first

**What's Needed**:
- Recursive preprocessing of included files before returning tokens
- Proper include stack management
- Macro definition propagation across include boundaries

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days additional work

## 🎯 Recommendations

### **Option 1: Ship As-Is** (Recommended)
**Pro**: 
- ✅ Core functionality working
- ✅ Solves simple include cases
- ✅ Production quality
- ✅ Zero regressions

**Con**:
- ⚠️ Doesn't solve OpenTitan's 14 failures
- ⚠️ Nested includes need more work

**Use Case**: Projects with simple/moderate include structures

### **Option 2: Additional Work for Deep Nesting**
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Tasks**:
1. Implement recursive preprocessing
2. Handle macro scope across includes
3. Test with OpenTitan files

**Benefit**: Would solve the 14 OpenTitan failures

### **Option 3: Document Limitation**
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Action**: Update docs to clarify nested include limitation
**Benefit**: Clear expectations for users
