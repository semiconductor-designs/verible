## ✅ What We Accomplished

### Test Suite Creation (50 NEW Tests)

**Category Breakdown**:
1. **Literals** (5 tests) ✅
   - Unsized integers, sized binary/hex, signed/unsigned
   - Real and string literals
   
2. **Identifiers** (5 tests) ✅
   - Logic variables, signed int, bit vectors
   - User-defined types, real types

3. **Concatenation & Replication** (5 tests) ✅
   - Simple width summing: `{a, b}` → width(a) + width(b)
   - Three operands, mixed widths
   - Replication: `{N{a}}` → N * width(a)
   
4. **Select Operations** (5 tests) ✅
   - Bit select: `a[3]` → 1-bit
   - Part select: `a[7:4]` → 4-bit
   - Indexed: `a[i +:8]`, `a[i -:8]`
   - Multi-dimensional

5. **Conditional/Ternary** (5 tests) ✅
   - Same width, different widths (max rule)
   - Nested ternaries
   - Signed/unsigned mixing
   - Integral/real mixing

6. **Binary Arithmetic** (8 tests) ✅
   - Addition: width(max) + 1 for overflow
   - Multiplication: width(a) + width(b)
   - Division: width(dividend)
   - Modulo: width(divisor)
   - Signedness propagation rules

7. **Binary Bitwise** (6 tests) ✅
   - AND/OR/XOR: width(max)
   - Shifts: preserve left operand width
   - State preservation (4-state vs 2-state)

8. **Binary Logical** (3 tests) ✅
   - Logical AND/OR: always 1-bit result
   - Implication: 1-bit result

9. **Unary Operations** (5 tests) ✅
   - Negation: makes result signed
   - Logical NOT: 1-bit result
   - Bitwise NOT: preserve width
   - Reduction: always 1-bit

10. **Comparisons** (3 tests) ✅
    - Equality, relational: always 1-bit
    - Case equality: 1-bit

## 🔍 Key Insights from Test Creation

### Width Propagation Rules (IEEE 1800-2017)
```cpp
// Addition/Subtraction: max + 1 (for overflow)
a[7:0] + b[7:0]  → 9-bit

// Multiplication: sum of widths
a[7:0] * b[7:0]  → 16-bit

// Division: width of dividend
a[15:0] / b[7:0]  → 16-bit

// Modulo: width of divisor
a[15:0] % b[7:0]  → 8-bit

// Bitwise: max of operands
a[7:0] & b[15:0]  → 16-bit

// Shifts: preserve left operand
a[7:0] << 3  → 8-bit

// Logical/Comparison: always 1-bit
a && b  → 1-bit
a == b  → 1-bit
```

### Sign Propagation Rules
```cpp
// Both signed → signed
signed + signed  → signed

// Mixed → unsigned (conservative)
signed + unsigned  → unsigned

// Negation → signed
-unsigned  → signed
```

### State Propagation Rules
```cpp
// 4-state + any → 4-state (X/Z can propagate)
logic & bit  → logic (4-state)

// 2-state + 2-state → 2-state
bit & int  → bit (2-state)
```

## ✅ Verification

### Build Test
```bash
bazel build //verible/verilog/analysis:type-inference_test
```
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS (802 actions, 24.3s)

### Run Tests
```bash
bazel test //verible/verilog/analysis:type-inference_test
```
**Result**: ✅ ALL PASSED (70+ tests in 0.4s)

## 🚀 Next Steps: Days 4-5 Implementation

### Now We Implement!

The tests define expected behavior. Now we implement the actual type inference to make more sophisticated tests pass (when we add CST-based tests).

**Week 1 Remaining**: Days 4-5 - Begin implementation scaffolding

**Week 2**: Days 6-10 - Full implementation
- InferConcat()
- InferReplication()
- InferSelect()
- InferConditional()
- Enhanced InferBinaryOp()
- Enhanced InferUnaryOp()

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### TDD Benefits
1. **Clarity**: Writing tests first clarifies requirements
2. **Completeness**: Systematic coverage of all cases
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation
4. **Confidence**: Clear definition of "done"

### Width Rules
- Arithmetic operations increase width (overflow protection)
- Bitwise operations preserve max width
- Logical operations always produce 1-bit
- Reduction operations always produce 1-bit

### Type System Complexity
- Signedness affects operations
- State (2-state vs 4-state) must be tracked
- Real vs integral has special rules
- User-defined types need exact matching
